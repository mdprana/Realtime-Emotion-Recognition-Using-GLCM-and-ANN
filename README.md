# Realtime Emotion Recognition

Our GitHub repository houses a cutting-edge project titled "Dynamic Emotion Recognition System with GLCM and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)"â€”a groundbreaking exploration into real-time emotion analysis. Leveraging the power of Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and the versatility of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), this project aims to revolutionize emotion recognition technology.

Emotions play a pivotal role in human communication and interaction. Understanding and interpreting emotions accurately in real-time scenarios is a challenging task with significant implications across various domains, including human-computer interaction, healthcare, and entertainment.

The core of our project lies in the utilization of GLCM, a texture analysis technique, which captures spatial dependencies within images. By extracting texture features from facial images, we can discern subtle patterns indicative of different emotions. This allows our system to robustly analyze facial expressions and infer underlying emotions with remarkable precision.
